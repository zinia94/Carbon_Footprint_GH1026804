# Carbon_Footprint_GH1026804

<h2>Project's Title:</h2>
   A python based application to calaculate the carbon footprint of organizations/companies

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
   This application calculates the carbon footprint for three sectors:
   
   1. Energy Usage
   2. Waste
   3. Business Travel

   It asks users some questions, and based on the answers, it calculates the amount of carbon footprint. It features:
   
   1. Carbon footprint calculation
   2. Showing the history of previously calculated carbon footprints
   3. Providing suggestions to reduce carbon footprint

   It has been created using the Python Flask Framework for both frontend and backend.

   The application has been primarily developed to serve the purpose of learning Python and applying it in practice. To use this application in the real world, more features and improved       accuracy in the calculation of carbon footprint are required.

   A demo of the application has been presented in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chLfWDJtjlY

   This project has been developed for the assignment of the course **Computer Programming (M602A)** in my MEng studies.

<h2>How to Install and Run the Project:</h2>
